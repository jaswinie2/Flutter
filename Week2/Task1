a) Install Flutter SDK and Dart SDK on your system

Step 1: System Requirements
•	OS: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux.
•	Disk space: 1.64 GB (does not include IDE/tools).
•	Tools: Git must be installed.

Step 2: Download and Install Flutter
1.	Go to the official site: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2.	Choose your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux).
3.	Download the Flutter SDK.
4.	Extract the zip file to a suitable location (e.g., C:\flutter).
5.	Add the Flutter bin directory to your system PATH.

Update your Windows PATH variable

To run Flutter commands in PowerShell, add Flutter to the PATH environment variable. This section presumes that you installed the Flutter SDK in %USERPROFILE%\dev\flutter.
1.	Press Windows + Pause.
If your keyboard lacks a Pause key, try Windows + Fn + B.
The System > About dialog displays.
2.	Click Advanced System Settings > Advanced > Environment Variables...
The Environment Variables dialog displays.
3.	In the User variables for (username) section, look for the Path entry.
1.	If the entry exists, double-click on it.
The Edit Environment Variable dialog displays.
1.	Double-click in an empty row.
2.	Type %USERPROFILE%\dev\flutter\bin.
3.	Click the %USERPROFILE%\dev\flutter\bin entry.
4.	Click Move Up until the Flutter entry sits at the top of the list.
5.	Click OK three times.
2.	If the entry doesn't exist, click New....
The Edit Environment Variable dialog displays.
1.	In the Variable Name box, type Path.
2.	In the Variable Value box, type %USERPROFILE%\dev\flutter\bin
3.	Click OK three times.
4.	To enable these changes, close and reopen any existing command prompts and PowerShell instances.

Check your development setup
Run Flutter doctor
The flutter doctor command validates that all components of a complete Flutter development environment for Windows.
1.	Open PowerShell.
2.	To verify your installation of all the components, run the following command.
PS C:> flutter doctor
content_copy
As you chose to develop for desktop, you do not need all components. If you followed this guide, the command should output [✓] for the tooling and platforms you set up.
Troubleshoot Flutter doctor issues
#
When the flutter doctor command returns an error, it could be for Flutter, VS Code, Visual Studio, the connected device, or network resources.
If the flutter doctor command returns an error for any of these components, run it again with the verbose flag.
PS C:> flutter doctor -v


✅ Method 1: Using Command Line (Terminal)
Step 1: Install Dart (if not using Flutter)
•	Download from: https://dart.dev/get-dart
Note: If Flutter is installed, Dart is already included.
Step 2: Create and Run Dart Program
1.	Open terminal or command prompt.
2.	Create a file, e.g., hello.dart:
dart
CopyEdit
void main() {
  print('Hello, Dart!');
}
3.	Run the file:
bash
CopyEdit
dart hello.dart

Method 2: Using Visual Studio Code (Recommended)
Step-by-step:
1.	Install Visual Studio Code
2.	Install Dart and Flutter extensions:
o	Go to Extensions tab → Search for Dart and Flutter → Click Install
3.	Create a Dart file:
o	File → New File → Save as main.dart
4.	Write your Dart code.
5.	To run:
o	Open terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+~)
o	Run: dart main.dart
void main() {
  // Variables and Data Types
  int age = 25;
  double height = 5.9;
  String name = 'Ramesh';
  bool isStudent = true;

  print('Name: $name');
  print('Age: $age');
  print('Height: $height');
  print('Is a student: $isStudent');

  // Control Structure: if-else
  if (age > 18) {
    print('$name is an adult.');
  } else {
    print('$name is a minor.');
  }

  // Loops: for loop
  print('Counting from 1 to 5:');
  for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    print(i);
  }

  // Functions
  greet(name);
}

// Function definition
void greet(String personName) {
  print('Hello, $personName! Welcome to Dart.');
}

Linux Operating System
*******************
✅ Step 1: System Requirements
•	OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or later (64-bit)
•	Disk Space: 2.8 GB (excluding IDE/tools)
•	Tools: bash, curl, git, unzip, xz-utils, libglu1-mesa

✅ Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
Open a terminal and run:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git unzip xz-utils zip libglu1-mesa -y

✅ Step 3: Download the Flutter SDK
Download the stable Flutter release:
cd ~
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.22.0-stable.tar.xz
tar xf flutter_linux_3.22.0-stable.tar.xz

✅ Step 4: Add Flutter to PATH
Add the Flutter tool to your PATH by editing .bashrc or .zshrc:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/flutter/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
If using Zsh:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/flutter/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

✅ Step 5: Run Flutter Doctor
Check your environment setup:
flutter doctor

Create and Run Dart Program
Open terminal or command prompt.
Create a file, e.g., hello.dart:

void main() {
  print('Hello, Dart!');
}
Run the file:
dart hello.dart

void main() {
  // Variables and Data Types
  int age = 25;
  double height = 5.9;
  String name = 'Ramesh';
  bool isStudent = true;

  print('Name: $name');
  print('Age: $age');
  print('Height: $height');
  print('Is a student: $isStudent');
  // Control Structure: if-else
  if (age > 18) {
    print('$name is an adult.');
  } else {
    print('$name is a minor.');
  }
  // Loops: for loop
  print('Counting from 1 to 5:');
  for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    print(i);
  }
  // Functions
  greet(name);
}

// Function definition
void greet(String personName) {
  print('Hello, $personName! Welcome to Dart.');
}
